There are several options that can make your notary run even better.


1. Set up caching!

Data caching will significantly increase your notary's performance.

For best performance you may want to use a dedicated caching server such as memcached, memcachier, or redis. If you do not have access to or don't want to set up a dedicated caching server, use the built-in python caching with '--pycache'.
