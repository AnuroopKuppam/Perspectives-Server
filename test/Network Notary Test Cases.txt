Test cases for Perspectives Server code. Feel free to add more!

Each utility module can be unit-tested on its own as well.


- Does the server start up?
	- Even in a hosted environment where cherrypy can't rely on the PORT?
- Does it automatically create a private key if none exists?
- Does it connect to the database?
	- sqlite
	- postgresql
- Does it automatically create tables if none exist?


While Running:
--------------
- If we get a request for an unknown service, does the server spawn a query process to ask about it?
	- Are the results properly reported back to the database?
- If we have data do we display the results?
	- Including multiple keys for a given service?
- If the visitor simply goes to the index do they get the HTML explanation page?
	- Are the public key and version number displayed?
- If the service_type is unknown do they get a 404 error?
- Does the favicon work?
